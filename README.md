# Rotate-a-2D-square-matrix-by-90-degrees-in-clockwise-direction-with-out-any-extra-space
Given a 2D square matrix, rotate the matrix by 90 degrees in clockwise manner without using any extra space and then print the rotated matrix.


Input Format

First line of input contains T - number of test cases. First line of each test case contains N - size of the matrix [NxN]. Its followed by N lines each containing N integers - elements of the matrix. 

Constraints

1 <= T <= 100 
1 <= N <= 100 
-100 <= ar[i][j] <= 100 

Output Format

For each test case, print the rotated matrix, separated by newline.
